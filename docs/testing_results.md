# Mnemo v0.2 — Test Suite Results

**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Total:** 85 passed, 0 failed, 1 warning (Pydantic v2 deprecation, cosmetic)
**Runtime:** ~170 seconds (dominated by sentence-transformer warm-up and DB round-trips)

## Test Infrastructure

All integration tests use:
- **ASGI transport** via `httpx.AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app))` — no real HTTP server
- **asyncpg pool** shared across all tests via `asyncio_default_test_loop_scope=session` (pytest-asyncio)
- **`clean_db` fixture** (autouse) truncates all mutable tables before each test; skips `access_log` (intentional — audit trail is append-only)
- **`agent` / `two_agents` fixtures** for pre-registered test agents
- **`pool` fixture** for direct SQL access (bypasses API dedup logic in consolidation tests)

## Suite Breakdown

### 1. `test_decomposer.py` — 26 tests

Unit tests for the rule-based free-text decomposer. No database or async required.

| Class / Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `TestTypeClassification` (10 tests) | Correct atom_type assigned for episodic (first-person, past tense, temporal), procedural (always/never/should/to-prevent), and semantic (general fact) sentences. Short fragments produce no atoms. |
| `TestConfidenceInference` (6 tests) | Beta parameters correctly assigned: episodic = α8/β1, procedural/semantic = α4/β2. Hedging ("I think maybe") increases β. Uncertainty keywords ("could be") produce very low confidence. Verification keywords ("definitely", "confirmed") boost to α8/β1. |
| `TestMergeAdjacent` (3 tests) | Adjacent same-type sentences are merged into a single atom with combined text and max α. Different types are not merged. |
| `TestEdgeInference` (4 tests) | Canonical spec example produces episodic→semantic (evidence_for) and procedural→semantic (motivated_by). Episodic→procedural edge when no semantic is present. No self-edges. No edges for single atom. |
| `TestStructuredExtraction` (2 tests) | Inline backtick code is extracted into `structured.code`. Sentences without code produce empty structured dict. |
| `test_spec_example_full` (1 test) | Full spec example: 3-sentence input → 3 typed atoms + 2 edges. Episodic confidence α=8. |

**Edge cases verified:** The merge-adjacent rule takes `max(alpha)` and `min(beta)` to preserve the most confident signal from merged sentences.

### 2. `test_api.py` — 35 tests

Integration tests for all REST endpoints. Each test class covers one resource.

| Class | Tests | Key scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| `TestAgents` | 7 | Register, get, not-found 404, stats empty, depart, depart-twice → 409, departed agent cannot remember → 410 |
| `TestRemember` | 5 | Creates ≥2 atoms + ≥1 edge, returns typed atoms, exposes only confidence_expected/effective (not raw α/β), deduplication merges near-identical text, updates stats |
| `TestRecall` | 5 | Returns relevant atom, empty when no memories, filters by atom_type, enforces agent isolation, response structure |
| `TestAtoms` | 5 | Explicit atom creation with confidence level, get by ID, delete → 204 + 404, link atoms with edge, duplicate link → 409 |
| `TestViews` | 5 | Create view, list views, export_skill structure (name/procedures/supporting_facts/rendered_markdown), wrong-owner → 403, snapshot freezes pre-existing atoms |
| `TestCapabilities` | 7 | Grant, list shared_views, recall through shared view, recall without capability → 403, revoke removes access, departure cascade-revokes grants, grant-wrong-owner → 403 |
| `test_health` | 1 | `/v1/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}` |

**Key design properties tested:**
- `confidence_alpha` and `confidence_beta` are never exposed in API responses
- Deduplication: near-identical text (cosine > 0.90) increments `duplicates_merged` and creates no new atom
- Agent isolation: Bob cannot retrieve Alice's atoms via `/recall`
- Snapshot immutability: `atom_count` reflects atoms at snapshot time, not current DB state
- Cascade revoke: agent departure soft-revokes all granted capabilities via `revoke_agent_capabilities()` SQL function
- Scope safety: recall through a shared view is bounded to the snapshot's atom set

### 3. `test_consolidation.py` — 11 tests

Integration tests for `run_consolidation(pool)`. Use direct SQL insertion to bypass API dedup, enabling precise setup.

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_decay_deactivates_old_atoms` | Atoms aged 365 days have effective_confidence ≈ 1e-8, below 0.05 threshold → deactivated. `active_atoms == 0` after run. |
| `test_decay_does_not_touch_fresh_atoms` | Fresh atoms keep `effective_confidence` well above 0.05 → not deactivated. |
| `test_cluster_creates_generalised_atom` | 3 episodic atoms with identical embeddings → `clustered >= 1`, new semantic atom with `source_type='consolidation'` created, ≥1 `generalises` edge exists. |
| `test_cluster_requires_three_atoms` | 2 similar atoms → `clustered == 0` (minimum cluster size = 3). |
| `test_already_generalised_atoms_are_skipped` | Second consolidation run on same cluster → `clustered == 0`. The "skip already generalised" guard in the SQL query prevents re-clustering. |
| `test_merge_duplicates_combines_atoms` | Two atoms with identical embeddings (same agent, same type): older survives with updated α, newer deactivated. Bayesian merge: α = α₁ + α₂ − 1. |
| `test_merge_does_not_merge_different_types` | Episodic + semantic with identical embeddings: no merge (type must match). Both remain active. |
| `test_purge_deletes_expired_departed_agents` | Agent with `data_expires_at = yesterday`: deleted from `agents` table (cascades atoms/views). |
| `test_purge_keeps_agents_with_future_expiry` | Agent with `data_expires_at = +29 days`: not deleted. |
| `test_purge_removes_capability_references` | Capability FK cleanup before agent delete (no ON DELETE CASCADE on `grantor_id`/`grantee_id`). Run succeeds without FK violation. |
| `test_consolidation_writes_audit_log` | Each run inserts exactly 1 row to `access_log` with `action='consolidation'`. |

**Notable behaviour discovered during development:**

The cluster and merge steps interact in a non-obvious way. When 3 atoms with identical embeddings are inserted:
1. **Cluster step** creates a generalised semantic atom N with edges N→A, N→B, N→C
2. **Merge step** then detects A, B, C as near-duplicates (cosine = 1.0 > 0.90) and merges B into A, C into A
3. During merge of B into A: the code deletes edges from N that would conflict (N→A already exists when reassigning N→B). Net result: only N→A survives.

This means after a combined cluster+merge run, the generalised atom has only 1 edge instead of 3. **This is correct** — the episodic cluster members collapsed into a single survivor, so one edge is the accurate representation. The test assertion is `edge_count >= 1` with a comment explaining the interaction.

## Bugs Found and Fixed During Development

| Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `assert r.status_code == 200` in consolidation tests | `/remember` returns 201 Created, not 200 OK | Changed assertions to `== 201` |
| `assert edge_count >= 3` in cluster test (actual: 1) | Cluster step creates 3 edges, then merge step consolidates the 3 identical episodic atoms, leaving only 1 edge on the surviving atom | Changed assertion to `>= 1` with explanatory comment; documented the cluster+merge interaction |
| FK violation during purge | `capabilities` table has `grantor_id`/`grantee_id` FKs without `ON DELETE CASCADE` | Added explicit `DELETE FROM capabilities WHERE grantor_id = ANY(ids) OR grantee_id = ANY(ids)` before agent delete |

## Coverage Gaps

The following scenarios are **not tested** and represent known gaps:

1. **Concurrent consolidation runs** — no test for what happens if two consolidation jobs run simultaneously (race condition on the cluster/merge steps)
2. **Snapshot recall after consolidation** — no test verifying that a shared view's recall results change (or don't change) after consolidation deactivates atoms that were in the snapshot
3. **Capability expiry** (`expires_at` column) — the schema supports time-limited capabilities but no test exercises this
4. **`parent_cap_id` chained capabilities** — the recursive CTE in `revoke_agent_capabilities` handles delegation chains, but no test creates a multi-hop chain
5. **Large embedding batches** — no performance test for the O(N²) cluster self-join at scale
6. **Decomposer with non-English text** — not tested; the sentence transformer is English-optimised
7. **`consolidation_loop` background scheduling** — the async loop wrapper is not tested; only `run_consolidation()` directly
